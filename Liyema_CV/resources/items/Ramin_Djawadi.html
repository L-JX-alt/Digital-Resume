    <p>Ramin Djawadi is a prolific small and big screen composer. With over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi#Works_and_awards" target="_blank">100 scores</a> at the time of this artcile's publication, chances are, he composed one of your favourite films, namely <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1014697/" target="_blank">Iron Man and Pacific Rim</a> just to name a few. However, it was his work on the televised cultural phenomenon Game of Thrones that truly launched him into the mainsteam. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>In order to guage his appeal, one has to break down how he composes a score in order to further enhance a partciualr scene or character, in this case, we will look at his work on Game of Thones and touching on:

    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="Instrumentation and Character">
    <h2 class="point">Instrumentation and Character</h2>
      <p> What makes Djawadi's scores disctinct and memorable is how he melds certain instruments with a certain characters. For the purpose of simplicity, the main charcter of focus will be Daenerys Targaryen</p>
         <h3 class="character">Daenerys Targaryen</h3>
           <p>A character that holds many titles; Mhysa, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains just to name a few. But whatever the sobriquet, the audience gets a hint sonically when the direction changes from <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westeros" target="_blank">Westeros</a> to <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vaes_Dothrak" target="_blank"> Vaas Dothrak</a>.</p>
           
          <h4 class="season">Season 1</h4>
              <p>We are first introduced to Daenyrus with the score, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/19kA9MB5gD4xX27NFmBTVs?si=jyEjY4cyTc2HQzTe_oE5Xg" target="_blank">Love In The Eyes.</a><br>
              <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/19/18484819/game-of-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-costumes-michele-clapton" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VIjGfXXtLu6aAt2cKsQiKejF1B0=/0x0:1920x1080/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16162223/dany_khai_drogo_629651_7_1920.jpg"  alt=" Daenerys first meeting her Khal husbad in sheath dress"/></a><br>The main instruments that are heard are the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/game-of-thrones-composer-ramin-djawadi-key-musical-elements.html" target="_blank">Armenian duduk flute, followed by slow, menacing Japanese taiko-inspired drums, Indonesian bedug drums</a> and an almost Indian-esque guitar strummed with a quick pace. Note that these dominant instruments are not Western and is not used for any other character introduction throughout all 7 seasons. It not only sets an otherwordly, exotic and easertern feel and look to Daenerys and the Dorthraki, it also gives a sign to the audience that the next scene will be focused on her or her storyline. Djawadi reprises these instruments for her last scene of season 1 with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6TYzaO31pog2PwBm4O7OOM?si=a4UYeRF8ScWKSCcOYbltYQ" target="_blank">Fire and Blood</a>.<br><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/19/18484819/game-of-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-costumes-michele-clapton"><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o5HDHD7BDw1zfs9U_44aRDCyAA=/0x0:1200x675/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1200x675):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16162417/1_6.jpeg" alt="Daenerys naked and ashen, with baby dragon on shoulder"></a><br>The audience has a sense of her gaining power as the drums cresendo and Djawadi signals her move to Westeros by adding strings, which is usually the instruemnt reserved for the Westrosi characters. The duduk flute bleeds into the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Z0QYWxOndrwwtiUyybjSl?si=Iodnqbe2T2mx4AjfOtoBpw" target="_blank">Finale</a>, and then it is drowned out by a full string orchestra and a choir, with drums driving up the intesnity. Another scores of note is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6hJA1KQ8AK2r1mazUOQWGM?si=V2z8bvu_QQO3WBx_PJmEcA" target="_blank">To Vaes Dorthrak</a>and<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/791hJyQ1Z3U9BmmFryEKPQ?si=v2Us-FQoRguYRG5xCQSXhg" target="_blank">When the Sun Rises in the West</a>.To purchase this album, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Ramin-Djawadi/dp/B004ZQRETK" target="_blank">click here.</a></p>

          <h4 class="season">Season 2</h4>
             <p>The most notable of Daenerys's theme song is heard at the latter half of the season: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3czgLTPcYPQlkcnMeVxziP?si=vrXylnXmQiSJUQx2l6Yf2w" target="_blank">Mother of Dragons</a>. It starts off with a lone Dudek flute or a Nay flute, harried by drums and a vibratoed violin. Wesetern instruments start to enter just as quickley, with bits of the Dudek/Nay Flute in it's wake. The intesnity of the drums increase dramatically, with some hint of a choir humming. Other scores of note is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/35LiLCqiC0cdjH1c5RmSTG?si=ALioyLTrQ42OVMMwNsPGSQ" target="_blank">Qarth</a> with the spine-chilling Dudek's and Ney winds with a Kanun (Turkish Zither) serving as the string component and... bird sounds? You be the judge of that! Lastly, the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1tICQXzFx0j6zcNFOM66z1?si=mV9RcnlxTcKNFXxXk7AHJw" target="_blank">House of the Undying</a>where the eastern instruments are pulled back, making space for a more ominous sound. Game of Thrones Season 2 Soundtrack is availible for purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Season-Music-HBO/dp/B07472NNZC" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="season">Season 3</h4>
             <p>Season 3 only has about 2 Daenerys motifs. The first,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1eW5pYWfahrmseEKvCyoYR?si=jHzJPiKbTqysxtpzSSFTBw" target="_blank">Dracarys,</a> marks the realtionship between Daenerys and her dragons. The lone string makes its foreboding entrance, and at its background is a bass cello holding a sustained note... its sound is akin to throat-singing! Other unidentifiable sounds mar the string's passage as well as pauses. The string then tremelo's and fades into the background as the drums enter truimphantly with a male choir chanting. The most famous part of this motif is how the stringed-instrumnt/Nay flute trills and slides down the scale forebodingly, letting the audience know that the dragon is either coming or is about to breath fire! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4wxaEgPlUbEUwiAnThBUkw?si=AdsDh3XDRXW_R44NYultGA" target="_blank">Mhysa</a> marks the second last song (which is a noticable pattern for Daenerys' motifs) of the soundtrack; a choir starts off hummimg, aided by the some woodwind...that it. The choir then sings in Valaryian with sound following their lead. Children start singing to stop just as suddenly: a drum roll begins and everyone sinings in unison. Bells are heard and strings join in, with the interspersion of the choir. All instruments and voices are in tandem. The soundtrack can be purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Music-HBO%C2%AE-Season/dp/B00D4IFD4I" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

          <h4 class="season">Season 4</h4>
             <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2pqtxEdUxTrEsG5XVXB7Oy?si=Lv9AfapUT0iJqr2xIFE9uA" target="_blank">Breaker of Chains</a> is a reprise of Mother of dragons (the quitetude, then the mornful eastern strings. Next, there are instruments that sound almost like a didgeridoo or a low (blow) horn with violins playing a high, sustained note: everything is still rather still. Then, drums enter menacingly in steps, with lilting horns calling out. The strings play appregio's, there is a push and pull moment between all of the intruments as they ramp up to the finale and fall beautifully. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4mIvuyyHERWG5G30vbwAVb?si=lKHL4OoZSma2Wc3GKcQk6g" target="_blank">Mereen</a> starts with drums which is a reminder of Vaes Dorthrak. There is some Kanun and trilling Nay flutes which gives a desert, exotic feel that is the city of Mereen. Lastly, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4xZlFO2AFLeJ1SIwNdFhl0?si=_9CxKssdSgOy_5g88tp9oQ" target="_blank">Forgive Me</a> uses similar similar sounds to Breaker of Chains and there is a subtle call-back to Dracarys at around 1:00 of the song. The soundtrack can be purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Season-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B07BSTFJG7" target="_blank">here.</a></p> 

          <h4 class="season">Season 5</h4>
             <p>This season was Dragon themed: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0Y7n1RE7g1kkPc6CQCdfuO?si=bIgab425RfmSUKpdrcxmFA" target="_blank">Blood of the Dragon</a> started things off with a little call back to Breaker of chains with the use of horn and, dare I say it, flute?(Flute: 0:00 - 0:35, Horn: 0:08 - 1:30. Ignore the drums and the violins and you will hear it) Note that at the 0:22 mark, the flute starts to fall a step behind the horn (As if the horn is calling and the flute is responding). <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/31ZZ6UK4InCAb3AgoNMKol?si=4nXfLsICSeGPlElzQ-L8Ww" target="_blank">Dance of Dragons</a> includes soaring strings and horns at the start, then with a sliding, tremelo of a stringed instrument signaling the dragon. The drums are emphasised, followed by a slight lull, then a call back to Breaker of Chains at the 1:35 mark (I have a feeling that Djawadi modulated the key, or put put some notes a step up). Then, an ominous tremelo of the violins/viola's disturb the reprise (with another reprise of reprise of Breaker of Chains), then it turns quite majestic, with a solo singer almost rising above the fray. The soundtrack can be purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Music-HBO-Season/dp/B00XJ3BIO2" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
           
          <h4 class="season">Season 6</h4>
             <p>Season 6 sees an increase of Daenerys laden motifs as Daenerys makes her way to Westeros, with at least 5 out of 26 songs on the soundtrack.
             <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-season-6-sets-894286" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDOX5PjWmeWQ78VE6eczQY8wCBM=/0x0:2100x1181/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2100x1181):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16162550/6_11.jpg" alt="Left to right: Tyrion, Missandei and Daenerys on a ship headed to Dragonstone"/></a><br><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7kMr7gQm5lzvwlc5VZHgMO?si=bcxmhFOdQOy3LtnM5iQ12A" target="_blank">Blood of My Blood</a> stays true to form, with strong sweeps of the strings (notice the increase of western instruments in Daenerys' themes as we progress through the seasons) which could be a reprise of Myhsa (the voice section). A male choir soon follows after the strings singing in Valaryian with a disntinct lyric: "AH-HA". A little bit of Eastern wind insruments can be heard, though it is in short bursts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6u6owGCGi6WDXtd4Tf9ZLk?si=zmZ11oJJTC2AVt-1-CwS9w" target="_blank">Khaleesi</a> introduces the chanting of a male chior (that almost sound like a war cry) with the women's soprano sections floating above the battle-esque sounds, and the instrumental clings closely to Blood of my Blood. It ends in the same fashion: the trilling and sliding of a stringed-instrumnt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0eporXhSjE9TsGX5TiR80F?si=VyqVee0pS8O9_tJln1yDww" target="_blank">Reign</a> begins with, what sound like a didgeridoo then it is quickely smothered by the strings and the choir. Again, it seems to be a reprise of Blood of my Blood, with a couple of changes. Adding to the cacophony of sounds is the choir sining the "AH-HA" refrain from Blood of my Blood. It almost seems like Djawadi flattened some notes and sharpened otheres, making it familiar yet different from the pattern of the other aformentioned scores. Finally, the favoured Winds of Winter. It starts off with women singing in Valaryian, with the men joining soon after. You can hear the trilling of a wind instrumnt as they sing, and then the choir sings the "AH-HA" refrain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0wXNnmvuTP0jPMpAXakSs8?si=jOzC8hhcRnm7jqp99TuWyQ" target="_blank">Winds of Winter</a> marks a song where the presence of a choir is there throughout. Another song of note is the bonus track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4tF6XrbWDuUutv8EZASRqj?si=ImNmbygbRIyhKwd4WilgiA" target="_blank">I Need You By My Side.</a> The soundtrack can be purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Season-Music-HBO/dp/B07P9DPC28" target="_blank">here</a></p>

          <h4 class="season">Season 7</h4>
             <p>Season 7 brings much beloved characters together, naimely Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Realising the importance of their newly entabgled storylines (in more ways than one, wink wink), Djawadi seemingly created some new melodies which will be explored in a moment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/65KG1BEtR85y2cvIaukuaO?si=Ya7sV0lbSTOAuKMdazo2Tw" target="_blank">Dragonstone</a> begins with an Eastern stringed instrument, followed swiftly by intense drums then it bleeds into a reprisal of Blood of my Blood played by the horn section in particular. We get the sense that we have arrived at Dragonstone. A female voices hums slowley and ominously. The male voices join a while after, chanting. It then cresendo's into the well known AH HA and fading out, a quiteude of sorts enetrs. Strings playing in a high register (drawn out) and it is argueable that this is the first time that a Daenerys motif ends forebodingly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6Rlybp1JsE3GUjYp5rC0mo?si=pJRIR8H_SsGsJQscU3MtBQ" target="_blank">Shall We Begin?</a> is also known as the moment where Daenerys and her new advisors begin to finally plan her ascention to the throne. Blood of my Blood is reprised, the AH-HA'S make their entrance and - I think- there were some changes made to the melody lines of the cello. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5PHmaOKveNjY2U8g3NTu2I?si=Snf7Z6tJSM-lZh8blvNExA" target="_blank">Gorgeous Beasts</a> still follows the pattern of Blood of my Blood and aforementioned scores, but this marks the first time Jon Snow has close contact with the Dragons. I think Djawadi covers the sense of Snow's awe of them, and around 0:36, his apprehension and fear of them with the string section playing light tremolos that seem to be rising and falling. An important motif happens at 1:13 of Gorgeous Beasts: it is the beginning of Daenerys and Jon's love theme. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Yz362ZLSTnk3ndIm1ZvZY?si=SJOZR6n3TQidYNNz-CwtJg" target="_blank">See You for What You Are</a> exapnads this motif with a lone cello  while the rest of the section takes a backseat, which is apt because this is when Daenrys confesses her affection to Jon and Jon recognizes her as her Queen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5QKK7785dSYrutocW7lGub?si=W_4LePptQuK2cxUxLkB7qw" target="_blank">Truth</a> is quite popular and Djawadi even performed it <a href="#Truth Video">live</a> on KCRW. It is the reprisal of See You, but it's more sweeping, urgent and luscious which again, apt seeing as it signifies Daenerys' first love scene with Jon. The soundtrack can be purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Music-HBO%C2%AE-Season/dp/B074L6VZZL" target="_blank">here</a></p>
